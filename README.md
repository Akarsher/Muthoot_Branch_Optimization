# Route Optimization Project  

This project is a **Route Optimization Tool** built in Python.  
It finds the most efficient route among multiple locations using optimization techniques, minimizing the total distance traveled.  

## üìå Features  
- Optimizes travel routes across multiple branches/locations.  
- Uses distance matrix calculations and optimization algorithms.  
- Easy to configure with your own dataset.  
- Can be extended with map visualization (e.g., Google Maps / OSRM).
